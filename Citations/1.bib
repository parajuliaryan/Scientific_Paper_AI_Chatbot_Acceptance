abstract = {The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has given rise to the field of Human-AI Interaction (HAII). This study meticulously reviewed the research themes, theoretical foundations, and methodological frameworks of the HAII field, aiming to construct a comprehensive overview of this field and provide robust support for future investigations. HAII research themes include human-AI collaboration, competition, conflict, and symbiosis. Theories drawn from communication, psychology, and sociology support these studies, while the employed methods include both self-reporting and observational approaches commonly utilized in user studies. It is suggested that future research should broaden its focus to encompass diverse user groups, AI roles, and tasks. Moreover, it is necessary to develop multi-disciplinary theories and integrate multi-level research methods to support the sustained development of the field. This study not only furnishes indispensable theoretical and practical insights for forthcoming research endeavors but also catalyzes the realization of a future distinguished by seamless interaction between humans and AI.}
